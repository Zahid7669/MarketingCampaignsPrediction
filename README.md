# MarketingCampaignsPrediction

For this mini project we are provided with a dataset. The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (yes') or not (no') subscribed. For this mini project our task is to train a Neural Network Model to predict whether a client would respond positive or negative to the campaign.
